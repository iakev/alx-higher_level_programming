## Program Descriptions

Below are the Python programs in this directory along with their descriptions:

### 0-print_list_integer.py

This program defines a function `print_list_integer(my_list)` that prints all integers of a list.

### 1-element_at.py

This program defines a function `element_at(my_list, idx)` that retrieves an element from a list like in C.

### 2-replace_in_list.py

This program defines a function `replace_in_list(my_list, idx, element)` that replaces an element at a specific position in a list.

### 3-print_reversed_list_integer.py

This program defines a function `print_reversed_list_integer(my_list)` that prints all integers of a list in reverse order.

### 4-new_in_list.py

This program defines a function `new_in_list(my_list, idx, element)` that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.

### 5-no_c.py

This program defines a function `no_c(my_string)` that removes all characters 'c' and 'C' from a string.

### 6-print_matrix_integer.py

This program defines a function `print_matrix_integer(matrix=[[]])` that prints a matrix of integers.

### 7-add_tuple.py

This program defines a function `add_tuple(tuple_a=(), tuple_b=())` that adds two tuples together.

### 8-multiple_returns.py

This program defines a function `multiple_returns(sentence)` that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.

### 9-max_integer.py

This program defines a function `max_integer(my_list=[])` that finds the largest integer in a list.

### 10-divisible_by_2.py

This program defines a function `divisible_by_2(my_list=[])` that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.

### 11-delete_at.py

This program defines a function `delete_at(my_list=[], idx=0)` that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.

### 12-switch.py

This program defines a function `switch(a, b)` that switches the values of two variables.

## How to Use

To run the programs in this directory, you can follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the Python file you want to run.

3. Use the `python` command followed by the filename to execute the program. For example:

   ```bash
   python 0-print_list_integer.py
   ```

Replace 0-print_list_integer.py with the name of the Python file you want to run.
