# 0x06 Python - Classes

Welcome to the **0x06 Python - Classes** directory of the **ALX Higher Level Programming** repository. In this section, you'll find Python programs and examples that focus on the concept of classes, a fundamental feature of object-oriented programming (OOP).

## Program Descriptions

Below are the Python programs in this directory along with their descriptions:

### [0-square.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x06-python-classes/0-square.py)

This program defines an empty class `Square`. It serves as a starting point for understanding class creation.

### [1-square.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x06-python-classes/1-square.py)

This program defines a class `Square` that initializes a private instance variable `size`. It demonstrates how to create a class with a constructor.

### [2-square.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x06-python-classes/2-square.py)

This program builds on the previous one by adding validation to the `size` attribute. It checks that `size` is an integer and a positive number.

### [3-square.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x06-python-classes/3-square.py)

This program extends the `Square` class to include a method `area()` that calculates the area of the square.

### [4-square.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x06-python-classes/4-square.py)

In this program, the `Square` class is further enhanced with getter and setter methods for the `size` attribute.

### [5-square.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x06-python-classes/5-square.py)

This program introduces the `Square` class with an additional attribute `position`. It validates `position` as a tuple of two positive integers and adjusts the square's position accordingly when printing.

### [6-square.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x06-python-classes/6-square.py)

The `Square` class in this program is further improved by adding the functionality to display the square using the `__str__()` method.

## Getting Started

To work with these Python programs, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming.git
```

2. Navigate to the `0x06-python-classes` directory:

 ```bash
 cd alx-higher_level_programming/0x06-python-classes
 ```

3. You can run the Python programs using a Python interpreter:

```bash
python3 program_name.py
```

Replace program_name.py with the name of the Python program you want to execute.
