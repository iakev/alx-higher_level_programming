## Program Descriptions

This directory contains Python scripts that demonstrate network-related tasks, including making HTTP requests, working with APIs, and more.

- [0-hbtn_status.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x11-python-network_1/0-hbtn_status.py): A Python script that fetches a URL using the `requests` library and displays the content.

- [1-hbtn_header.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x11-python-network_1/1-hbtn_header.py): A Python script that sends a GET request to a URL and displays the value of the `X-Request-Id` header variable.

- [2-post_email.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x11-python-network_1/2-post_email.py): A Python script that sends a POST request to a URL with an email address as a parameter and displays the response.

- [3-error_code.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x11-python-network_1/3-error_code.py): A Python script that sends a request to a URL and handles HTTP errors.

- [4-hbtn_status.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x11-python-network_1/4-hbtn_status.py): A Python script that fetches a URL using the `requests` library with error handling.

- [5-hbtn_header.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x11-python-network_1/5-hbtn_header.py): A Python script that sends a GET request to a URL and displays the `X-Request-Id` header variable using `requests`.

- [6-post_email.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x11-python-network_1/6-post_email.py): A Python script that sends a POST request to a URL with an email parameter using `requests`.

- [7-error_code.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x11-python-network_1/7-error_code.py): A Python script that sends a request to a URL and handles HTTP errors using `requests`.

- [8-json_api.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x11-python-network_1/8-json_api.py): A Python script that takes a letter and sends a POST request to a URL with the letter as a parameter. It displays the response.

- [10-my_github.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x11-python-network_1/10-my_github.py)

    This Python script takes your GitHub credentials (username and password) and uses the GitHub API to display your ID. It uses the `requests` library to make HTTP requests to the GitHub API.

    To run the script, you can use the following command:

    ```bash
    python 10-my_github.py <username> <password>
    ```

    Replace <username> and <password> with your GitHub username and password.




## How to Use

To use these Python scripts, you should have Python installed, preferably Python 3. You also need to have the `requests` library installed. You can install it using `pip`:

```bash
pip install requests
```
After installing the library, you can run any of the scripts using Python. For example:

```bash
python 0-hbtn_status.py
```
