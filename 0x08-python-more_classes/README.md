## Program Descriptions

Below are the Python programs in this directory along with their descriptions:

1. **1-rectangle.py**: Defines a class `Rectangle` that represents a rectangle.

2. **2-rectangle.py**: Adds validation to the `Rectangle` class to ensure that width and height are positive integers.

3. **3-rectangle.py**: Implements methods to calculate the area and perimeter of a `Rectangle`.

4. **4-rectangle.py**: Adds a `__str__` method to the `Rectangle` class for a more informative string representation.

5. **5-rectangle.py**: Adds a `__del__` method to the `Rectangle` class to print a message upon deletion.

6. **6-rectangle.py**: Adds a class attribute `number_of_instances` to keep track of the number of instances of `Rectangle` created.

7. **7-rectangle.py**: Adds a class attribute `print_symbol` to change the symbol used to print the rectangle.

8. **8-rectangle.py**: Adds a static method `staticmethod` that returns the biggest rectangle based on the area.

9. **9-rectangle.py**: Adds a class method `classmethod` that returns a new `Rectangle` instance with the dimensions of a square.

## How to Use

To use these Python programs, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `0x08-python-more_classes` directory:
  
  ```bash
  cd alx-higher_level_programming/0x08-python-more_classes
  ```

3. You can then run the Python programs using your preferred Python interpreter.
