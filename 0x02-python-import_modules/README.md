## Program Descriptions

Here are the Python programs in this directory along with their descriptions:

### 0-add.py

This program defines a function `add(a, b)` that returns the addition of two integers.

### 1-calculation.py

This program defines functions for basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

### 2-args.py

This program prints the number of and list of arguments passed to it.

### 3-infinite_add.py

This program adds all the numbers passed as arguments.

### 4-hidden_discovery.py

This program prints all the names defined by the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`.

### 5-variable_load.py

This program imports a variable from another file and prints its value.

## How to Use

To run these Python programs, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the Python file you want to run.

3. Use the `python` command followed by the filename to execute the program. For example:

```bash
python 0-add.py
```

The program will execute, and you will see the output in the terminal.
