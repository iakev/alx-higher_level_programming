## Description

In this directory, you will find Python programs and scripts that demonstrate how to handle exceptions and errors in Python. Exception handling is an essential part of writing robust and error-tolerant Python code. These programs cover various aspects of exception handling, including try-except blocks, raising exceptions, and more.

## Program Listings

Below are the Python programs in this directory along with their descriptions:

- [0-safe_print_list.py](0-safe_print_list.py): A Python function that safely prints elements from a list.
- [1-safe_print_integer.py](1-safe_print_integer.py): A Python function that safely prints an integer.
- [2-safe_print_list_integers.py](2-safe_print_list_integers.py): A Python function that safely prints the first `x` elements of a list that are integers.
- [3-safe_print_division.py](3-safe_print_division.py): A Python function that divides two integers and prints the result.
- [4-list_division.py](4-list_division.py): A Python function that divides two lists element-wise and returns a new list.
- [5-raise_exception.py](5-raise_exception.py): A Python script that raises a type exception.
- [6-raise_exception_msg.py](6-raise_exception_msg.py): A Python script that raises a name exception with a custom error message.

## Compilation and Execution

To run these Python programs, you can use the Python interpreter. Replace `program.py` with the name of the Python file you want to execute.

```bash
python program.py
```

For example, to run `0-safe_print_list.py`, you can use:

```bash
python 0-safe_print_list.py
```

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

## Resources

For further information on Python errors, exceptions, and exception handling, you can refer to the following resources:

- [Errors and Exceptions (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html): Python's official documentation explaining errors and exceptions in detail.

- [Learn to Program 11 Static & Exception Handling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gu9Jw1kCjo) (starting at minute 7): A video tutorial that covers static methods and exception handling in Python.

These resources will provide you with a deeper understanding of Python's error handling mechanisms.
