## Program Descriptions

Here are the Python programs in this directory along with their descriptions:

1. [0-run](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/main/0x00-python-hello_world/0-run) - A Shell script that runs a Python script, saving the Python code in the environment variable `$PYCODE`.

2. [1-run_inline](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/main/0x00-python-hello_world/1-run_inline) - A Shell script that runs Python code saved in the environment variable `$PYCODE`.

3. [2-print.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-python-hello_world/2-print.py) - A Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" followed by a new line.

4. [3-print_number.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-python-hello_world/3-print_number.py) - A Python script that prints the integer stored in the variable `number`, followed by "Battery street," and a new line.

5. [4-print_float.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-python-hello_world/4-print_float.py) - A Python script that prints the float stored in the variable `number` with a precision of 2 digits.

6. [5-print_string.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-python-hello_world/5-print_string.py) - A Python script that prints three times a string stored in the variable `str`, followed by its first 9 characters.

## Compilation and Execution

To run the Python scripts in this directory, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the Python script you want to run.

3. Use the `python` command to execute the script. Replace `script.py` with the name of the Python script you want to run:

   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```
For example, to run 2-print.py, you would use:

```bash
python 2-print.py
```
