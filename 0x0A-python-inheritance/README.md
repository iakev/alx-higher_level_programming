# 0x0A Python - Inheritance

Welcome to the **0x0A Python - Inheritance** directory of the **ALX Higher Level Programming** repository. In this section, you'll find Python programs that demonstrate the concept of inheritance, a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming.

## Program Descriptions

Below are the Python programs in this directory along with their descriptions:

### 0-lookup.py

This program defines a function `lookup(obj)` that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object.

### 1-my_list.py

This program defines a class `MyList` that inherits from the built-in list class. It adds a method to print a sorted list.

### 2-is_same_class.py

This program defines a function `is_same_class(obj, a_class)` that checks if an object is an instance of a specified class.

### 3-is_kind_of_class.py

This program defines a function `is_kind_of_class(obj, a_class)` that checks if an object is an instance of a class that inherited from a specified class.

### 4-inherits_from.py

This program defines a function `inherits_from(obj, a_class)` that checks if an object is an instance of a class that directly or indirectly inherited from a specified class.

### 5-base_geometry.py

This program defines a base class `BaseGeometry` with two empty methods, `area()` and `integer_validator()`.

### 6-base_geometry.py

This program defines a class `BaseGeometry` with methods for area calculation and integer validation.

### 7-base_geometry.py

This program defines a class `BaseGeometry` with additional methods for integer validation and area calculation with exceptions.

### 8-rectangle.py

This program defines a class `Rectangle` that inherits from `BaseGeometry`. It adds methods for area calculation and string representation.

### 9-rectangle.py

This program defines a class `Rectangle` that inherits from `BaseGeometry`. It adds methods for area calculation, string representation, and a custom print.

### 10-square.py

This program defines a class `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle`. It adds methods for area calculation and string representation.

### 100-my_int.py

This program defines a class `MyInt` that inherits from `int`. It overrides the equality operators to have a different behavior.

## Compiling and Executing

To run these Python programs, you can use the Python interpreter. For example, to execute `0-lookup.py`, you can use the following command:

```bash
python3 0-lookup.py
```

Replace `0-lookup.py` with the filename of the program you want to run.
