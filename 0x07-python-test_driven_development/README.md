# 0x07 Python - Test-driven development (TDD) - ALX Higher Level Programming

Welcome to the **0x07 Python - Test-driven development (TDD)** directory of the **ALX Higher Level Programming** repository. In this section, you'll find Python programs developed using the Test-driven Development (TDD) approach. TDD is a software development process that emphasizes writing test cases before writing the actual code, ensuring better code quality and reliability.

## Program Descriptions

Below are the Python programs in this directory along with their descriptions:

### 0-add_integer.py

This program defines a function `add_integer` that adds two integers and returns the result. It also includes test cases for the function.

### 2-matrix_divided.py

This program defines a function `matrix_divided` that divides all elements of a matrix by a given divisor and returns a new matrix with the result. It includes test cases for the function.

### 3-say_my_name.py

This program defines a function `say_my_name` that prints a custom message with the given first name and last name. It includes test cases for the function.

### 4-print_square.py

This program defines a function `print_square` that prints a square made of `#` characters with a specified size. It includes test cases for the function.

### 5-text_indentation.py

This program defines a function `text_indentation` that adds two newlines after certain characters to format text. It includes test cases for the function.

### 6-max_integer.py

This program defines a function max_integer(my_list) that finds and returns the largest integer from a list of integers. It also includes test cases using the unittest framework to verify the correctness of the function.
