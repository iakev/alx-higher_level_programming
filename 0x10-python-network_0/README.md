## Program Descriptions

Below are the Python scripts in this directory along with their descriptions:

- [0-body_size.sh](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x10-python-network_0/0-body_size.sh): This Bash script sends a GET request to a URL and displays the size of the response body in bytes.

- [1-body.sh](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x10-python-network_0/1-body.sh): This Bash script sends a GET request to a URL and displays the response body.

- [2-delete.sh](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x10-python-network_0/2-delete.sh): This Bash script sends a DELETE request to a URL and displays the response body.

- [3-methods.sh](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x10-python-network_0/3-methods.sh): This Bash script sends an OPTIONS request to a URL and displays the allowed HTTP methods.

- [4-header.sh](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x10-python-network_0/4-header.sh): This Bash script sends a GET request to a URL with a custom header variable and displays the response.

- [5-post_params.sh](https://github.com/iakev/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x10-python-network_0/5-post_params.sh): This Bash script sends a POST request with specific data to a URL and displays the response.


## How to Use

```bash
./0-body_size.sh
./1-body.sh
./2-delete.sh
./3-methods.sh
./4-header.sh
./5-post_params.sh
```

To run the Python script, you can execute it as follows:

```bash
python3 6-peak.py
```

Make sure to provide the necessary inputs or modify the scripts as needed.
